          <div class="separator"></div>
          <p>I am a second-year engineering student specializing in Electronics and Communication. I'm passionate about designing and coding, and I adore learning about the web development industry. Alongside web development, I also have experience in designing using tools like Canva and Figma. I have a strong interest in technology and am a naturally curious person who loves to learn new things. I enjoy giving back to communities much, and I take part in numerous hackathons and coding competitions. Another topic that interests me is networking because I value relationships and collaboration. I hope to have a positive impact on the IT industry through my abilities and enthusiasm.</p>

          <h5 class="items">TinkerHub Learning Initiative Intern</h5>
          <p>I was TinkerHub learning initiatives intern for about 6 months, where I was able to conduct 4 study jams being a part of a 4-member team. We were able to manage about 50+ students for each study jam. I was able to learn more about team management. As I had to coordinate with the participants, produce interesting content, and made sure the sessions went successfully, it was a demanding yet gratifying experience. I also developed skills like networking, and we made sure that the participants never felt bored or exhausted during the session. It was indeed a great experience for me that made me realize my strengths and weaknesses.</p>
          <h5 class="items">Designer</h5>
          <p>As a designer, I had the privilege of working at TinkerHub NSSCE and currently contributing to EDC NSSCE's media team. These experiences introduced me to tools like Figma and Canva, enhancing my design skills and fostering creativity. It has been an incredible journey of learning and growth, enabling me to deliver visually compelling designs.</p>
          <h5 class="items">Event's Lead - HultPrize NSSCE</h5>
          <p>During my tenure as the Events Lead at HultPrize NSSCE, I had the opportunity to build a vast network of contacts. Taking charge of organizing impactful events, I connected with industry professionals, mentors, and like-minded individuals. These valuable connections helped me broaden my perspective, gain insights, and develop lasting relationships within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. It was an enriching experience that not only strengthened my event management skills but also opened doors for future collaborations and opportunities.</p>
